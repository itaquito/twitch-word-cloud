# Twitch Word cloud

Create a word cloud that updates in real time based on your Twitch chat.

This app generates a link that you can use to embed the word cloud into your broadcast software as a browser source or just use it in a tab of your browser.

Everything runs on your browser, no backend needed! From the chat messages to the word cloud generation. You can host this app in basically any web hosting service.
